Your mind needs sleep to function. Its has to have a time when the constant barrage of simulents. you would go insane 
very fast without sleep. As a science project, a 14 year old boy decided to stay awake for as long as he could. Randy 
Gardner stay awake mush longer than what was good for him. he started to hallucenate, and couldn't tell the difference 
from his imagination to reality after a week. He collasped from exastion after 14 days of being awake.He took a long 
time ot recover, and even longer to return to his normal state of mind. 

Sleep is also the  time that your bady take to procese the day. it stores the important events into longterm memory, 
and throws out the junk. what did you eat for lunch 1 month ago, not important. And if something is really important, 
then you will dream about it. talk about death? have a nightmare about someone killing everyone you love.
