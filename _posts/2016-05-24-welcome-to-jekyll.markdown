First off sleep is also important for the growth of the human body. even for adalts that are done growing, if you hurt your knee its not going to fix itself while your moving and active. Sleep give a mush needed period of not moving. your body uses this to do functions that you couldn;t do while awake, like the aformentioned healing.  

If your a body builder then sleep is when your muscules grow better then before. When working out you are literly burning threw youe muscule. Your hurting your body so that it will come back stronger. But it won't come back at all without the proper conditions. 

Your body also needs that time to clean out all of the gunk that your body collected threwout the day. it clenses your blood, it cleans out your liver, it washes the arteries. your body would die if you didn't get sleep. You would be in despare and  nothing would work.
