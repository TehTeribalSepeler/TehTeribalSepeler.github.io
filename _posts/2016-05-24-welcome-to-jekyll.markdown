First off sleep is the basis of prosesing the day. Dreams are what your brain uses to go threw what it found hard to get its head around. If you had a conversation with your parents about what would happen if both of them died, your most likly goin gto have a nightmare about death (or dream if you into that kinda thing) 

Sleep is also important for the growth of the human body. even for adalts that are done growing, if you hurt your knee its not going to fix itself while your moving and active. Sleep give a mush needed period of not moving. your body uses this to do functions that you couldn;t do while awake, like the aformentioned healing.  

If your a body builder then sleep is when your muscules grow better then before. When working out you are literly burning threw youe muscule. Your hurting your body so that it will come back stronger. But it won't come back at all without the proper conditions. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
